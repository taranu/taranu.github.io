I am an astronomer/astrophysicist currently working at the [Department of Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) in New Jersey. I am a software developer for the [Data Management team](https://www.lsst.org/about/dm), responsible for Data Release Production for the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/). I am primarily working on software and algorithms for modelling galaxies and other astronomical sources (stars). This site will eventually explain the projects I'm working on in greater detail, but in the meantime, you can have a look at the [code I'm writing](https://github.com/lsst-dm/multiprofit) and some [results from it](https://github.com/lsst-dm/modelling_research) if you're so inclined.

A Brief Bio
======
I was born in Romania and grew up in Toronto, Canada. I obtained my BSc in Computational Physics from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I did a final year project with [Mike Hudson](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/mjhudson) studying the quenching of star formation in simulations of galaxy clusters. I completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the [Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), studying mergers in galaxy groups with simulations alongside my advisors [John Dubinski](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~dubinski/galaxydynamics/) and [Howard Yee](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~hyee/). I was then a [CAASTRO](http://caastro.org/) Postdoctoral Research Associate at [ICRAR](https://www.icrar.org)/[UWA](https://www.uwa.edu.au/), where I worked on more simulations, some photometric galaxy modelling with [Aaron Robotham](https://www.icrar.org/people/arobotham/) & co., and modelling galaxy dynamics with [Danail Obreschkow](https://www.icrar.org/people/dobreschkow/) and the [SAMI Galaxy Survey team](https://sami-survey.org/). You can read a bit more about that work on [my old website](https://www.icrar.org/people/dtaranu/).

What I Do in Plain-er English
======
Galaxies are collections of millions to billions of stars orbiting each other from their collective gravitational attraction. Our own Milky Way galaxy is a prime example. I write software and develop new algorithms to measure the distribution of stars in galaxies from digital photographs (a.k.a. photometry) and to model how the stars orbit by measuring small shifts in galaxy spectra from the Doppler effect. If that last part doesn't make sense, have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOW7lnTpcfA).

This Website
======
It's a work in progress. It is based on the [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/) template and is version-controlled [here](https://github.com/taranu/taranu.github.io). Eventually, all of the stock pages will be replaced with real content.
