permalink: /publication/2014-04-03-quenching-cluster-galaxies
excerpt: 'This undergraduate thesis paper presented simplified models for the evolution of star formation in galaxies in rich clusters. Comparioson of model predictions to observations showed that typical galaxies are quenched on longer exponential time-scales of 3-3.5 Gyr, whereas models with very rapid quenching (<1Gyr) are disfavoured as they produce excessively old and red galaxies.'
