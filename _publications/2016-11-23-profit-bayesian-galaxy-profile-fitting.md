ProFit is an R package for Bayesian galaxy profile fitting, which can be used to fit a variety of analytic profiles to astronomical sources and derive uncertainties on the model parameters. This paper describes the code and methodology with examples and results from the VLT Survey Telescope Kilo-Degree Survey (VST-KiDS).
