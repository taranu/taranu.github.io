excerpt: "This second paper from my PhD thesis concluded that Paper I's simulations follow a similar fundamental plane relation to observed ellipticals, but with a shallower slope, implying that some dissipation is likely necessary to form realistic ellipticals."

This second paper from my PhD thesis presented measurements of the fundamental plane scaling relation of elliptical galaxies from Paper I's simulations and compared them to observations. The simulations follow a similar relation to observed ellipticals, albeit with a shallower slope; this suggests that some degree of gas dissipation and star formation is required to form a realistic population of ellipticals.
