MagRite is a novel code and method for fitting self-consistent galaxy models to images and integral field kinematics. Unlike previous dyanmical modelling methods, MagRite's models are stable and fully self-consistent (able to fit images and kinematics simultaneously), and the code is efficient enough to generate a single model in a little over a minute. This paper describes the method and shows an example using SAMI Galaxy Survey data.
