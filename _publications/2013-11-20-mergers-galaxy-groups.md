title: "Mergers in Galaxy Groups. I. Structure and Properties of Elliptical Remnants"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2013-11-20-mergers-galaxy-groups
excerpt: 'This first paper from my PhD thesis presented novel N-body simulations of mergers of spiral galaxies in groups of three to twenty-five. Analysis of synthetic images and kinematic maps showed that the merger remnants formed in the centers of these groups have very similar properties to nearby elliptical galaxies, showing that multiple, gas-poor and sometimes minor mergers are an alternative formation mechanism to the previously favoured paradigm of a single gas-rich major merger.'
